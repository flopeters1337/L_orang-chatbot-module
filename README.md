## Description
Imagine hiring a butler for your home. One that could brew you coffee and report the status of your home when you're away.
Imagine if that butler was available 24/7. Imagine if that butler was completely free of charge.
This is the Palantir Project in a nutshell. It is a custom 'smartifying' home upgrade written in Python 
that aims at being as user-friendly as possible and also being modular enough so new devices can be added seamlessly 
to the Palantir ecosystem.
